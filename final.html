<p><b>Airport:</b>The Airport class controls the planes. The Airport class has an ArrayList of arriving 
  planes and an Array of departing planes because only a certain number of planes can depart at once. 
  It has start and end holiday season methods to double the price of the planes and make a storm happen. 
  When a storm happens, there is a 50% chance that each plane will be delayed. 
  <br><b>AirportDriver:</b> The AirportDriver class asks you what airport you are at and tells you the 
  planes. These planes are pre-set but their destination or starting point changes based on the answer. 
  Then it asks you what plane you want to book and sees if there are available seats on that plane and 
  if there are, it books one seat. Otherwise, it tells you there were no results found and asks you your 
  destination and seats again until you select one that works. 
  <br><b>Plane Abstract Class:</b>Each individual plane has an airline and has business and economy seats with prices. 
  They can be delayed or not delayed, and they have a starting location and a destination. 
  <br><b>BoeingPlane Interface:</b> Contains a gotToDestination method because all boeing planes may not arrive in 
  one peice
  <br><b>AirbusA320:</b> A plane
  <br><b>AntonovAn225:</b> A plane
  <br><b>EmbraerEJet:</b> A plane
  <br><b>Boeing737:</b> A boeing plane
  <br><b>Boeing747:</b> A boeing plane
  <br><b>Boeing777:</b> A boeing plane
